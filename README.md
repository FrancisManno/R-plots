# R-graph  
Inside each folder you'll find scripts for three different types of graphs done with R. You can find a README file, a png of the output and the R code.  
The graphs are the next:  
> **Linear model plot**: with confidence interval and boostrap statistics.  
> **Boxplot with density**: A modified boxplot with each point graphed and the ensity histogram.  
> **Lines plot**: or spaguetti plot where x values are the variables that describes the same object.
