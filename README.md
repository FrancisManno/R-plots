# R-Custom plots
Inside each folder you'll find scripts different types of plots done with R programming language. Inside each directory, you'll find a README with instructions, the R code for the plot and a png figure.  

List of plots:  
> **Linear model plot**: with confidence interval and boostrap statistics.  
> **Boxplot with density**: A modified boxplot with each point graphed and the ensity histogram.  
> **Lines plot**: or spaguetti plot where x values are the variables that describes the same object.  
> **Heatmap**: comming soon!  
> **Circular dendrogram** also comming soon!
