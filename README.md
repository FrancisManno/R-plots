Inside each folder you'll find scripts for three different types of graphs done with R. You can find a README file, a png of the output and the R code.  
The graphs are the next:  
> Linear model plot with confidence interval and boostrap statistics.  
> Boxplot with density: A modified boxplot with each point graphed and the ensity histogram.  
> Lines plot: or spaguetti plot where x values are the variables that describes the same object.
